# ResponsivePortfolio

## Development of a responsive website

Website utilises bootstrap styling to allow for a responsive behaviour of elements when viewed on multiple screen sizes.

- The website has three separate pages (About, Portfolio & Contact) that all use a "navbar" navigation header.
- The About page has an image that has text wrapping around it in all screen sizes above 576px.
- The portfolio page has an image set that changes from 1 to 2 to 3 per row as the screen size increases.

## Notes on required work

Currently the required javascript is inactive and non functioning and will need further setup.
